# Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

This repository contains implementations of various advanced machine learning techniques including Supervised Contrastive Learning, Transfer Learning on different modalities (images, video, audio, NLP), and Zero-Shot Transfer Learning using the CLIP model. These examples demonstrate the power of modern machine learning frameworks and models to tackle complex classification tasks using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
